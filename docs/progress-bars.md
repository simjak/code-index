# Progress Bar Implementation

## Overview

Added visual progress bars to the `codeindex build` command to provide real-time feedback during long-running indexing operations.

## Implementation Details

### Technology
- **Library**: Rich (https://github.com/Textualize/rich)
- **Reason**: Beautiful, modern terminal progress bars with excellent features

### Progress Tracking

The build command now shows:

1. **File Indexing Progress**
   - Total count of files to be indexed
   - Current file being processed
   - Progress bar with percentage
   - Estimated time remaining

2. **Summarization Progress**
   - Updates description to show when summarizing nodes
   - Shows how many nodes are being summarized per file

### Example Output

```
⠋ Indexing: app/src/features/vendors/vendor.tsx ━━━━━━━━━━━━━╸━━━━━━━━━━ 45% 125/280 0:01:23
```

When summarizing:
```
⠋ Summarizing 3 nodes in app/src/main.py ━━━━━━━━━━━━━╸━━━━━━━━━━ 45% 125/280 0:01:23
```

### Configuration

- **Transient**: Set to `false` so progress bar remains visible in logs
- **Columns**:
  - Spinner for activity indication
  - Text description of current operation
  - Progress bar
  - Task progress (X/Y format)
  - Time remaining estimate

## Benefits

1. **User Experience**: Users can see exactly what's happening and how long to wait
2. **Debugging**: Easy to identify which files take longest to process
3. **Professionalism**: Modern, polished CLI experience
4. **Transparency**: No more wondering if the process is stuck

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add separate progress bar for summarization batches
- Show summary success rate in real-time
- Add option to disable progress bar (for CI/CD environments)
- Track and display metrics (files/sec, nodes/sec)
